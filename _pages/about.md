My name is Milan Davis M. I graduated from College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
I have been working as QT/C++ Developer for last 1 year on Contract.
Now I have switched to RoR Developer Role, I love web technology and as it is very promising I looking to stick to it for long time. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
